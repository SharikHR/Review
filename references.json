    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is well documented to regain intrinsic metabolic properties and to better mimic the in vivo situation than two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Particularly, proline metabolism is critical for tumorigenesis since pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase (PYCR/P5CR) is highly expressed in various tumors and its enzymatic activity is essential for in vitro 3D tumor cell growth and in vivo tumorigenesis. PYCR converts the P5C intermediate to proline as a biosynthesis pathway, whereas proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) breaks down proline to P5C as a degradation pathway. Intriguingly, expressions of proline biosynthesis gene and proline degradation gene are up-regulated directly by c-Myc oncoprotein and p53 tumor suppressor, respectively, suggesting that the proline-P5C metabolic axis is a key checkpoint for tumor cell growth. Here, we report a metabolic reprogramming of 3D tumor cell growth by oncogenic Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an etiological agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. Metabolomic analyses revealed that KSHV infection increased nonessential amino acid metabolites, specifically proline, in 3D culture, not in 2D culture. Strikingly, the KSHV K1 oncoprotein interacted with and activated PYCR enzyme, increasing intracellular proline concentration. Consequently, the K1-PYCR interaction promoted tumor cell growth in 3D spheroid culture and tumorigenesis in nude mice. In contrast, depletion of expression markedly abrogated K1-induced tumor cell growth in 3D culture, not in 2D culture. This study demonstrates that an increase of proline biosynthesis induced by K1-PYCR interaction is critical for KSHV-mediated transformation in in vitro 3D culture condition and in vivo tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Current pre-clinical models of cancer fail to recapitulate the cancer cell behavior in primary tumors primarily because of the lack of a deeper understanding of the effects that the microenvironment has on cancer cell phenotype. Transcriptomic profiling of 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells from 2D and 3D cultures, subcutaneous or orthotopic allografts (from immunocompetent or immunodeficient mice), as well as ex vivo tumoroids, revealed differences in molecular signatures including altered expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, cell signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling. The 3D culture platforms had more in vivo-like transcriptional profiles than 2D cultures. In vivo tumors had more cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) while in vitro cultures had cells residing primarily in an epithelial or mesenchymal state. Ex vivo tumoroids incorporated aspects of in vivo and in vitro culturing, retaining higher abundance of cells undergoing EMT while shifting cancer cell fate towards a more mesenchymal state. Cellular heterogeneity surveyed by scRNA-seq revealed that ex vivo tumoroids, while rapidly expanding cancer and fibroblast populations, lose a significant proportion of immune components. This study emphasizes the need to improve in vitro culture systems and preserve syngeneic-like tumor composition by maintaining similar EMT heterogeneity as well as inclusion of stromal subpopulations.",
